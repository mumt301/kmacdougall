    <p>The Marías are an indie pop band from Los Angeles, California, 
        composed of Puerto Rican lead singer María Zardoya and Los Angeles native 
        and drummer Josh Conway. They are known for performing songs in both English 
        and Spanish, as well as infusing their music with elements like jazz percussion, 
        guitar riffs, smoke-velvet vocals and horn solos. In their live show, with Zardoya
        on lead vocals and Conway on drums, they are joined by Jesse Perlman on guitar and 
        Edward James on keyboards. <sub>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mar%C3%ADas">Wikipedia </a> </sub>
